# Bayesian statistics

The topic of this is the experiment of tossing an unfair coin for several times and deducing information on the real value of the parameter.

- The "Real Î¼" describes the real probability to observe "0".
- The "Number of samples" counts how often we toss the coin.

Below we can see the outcome of the experiment and a graph of the posterior distribution and the posterior mean. We have used Beta(1,1) as prior distribution.
